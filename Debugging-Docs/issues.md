So apparently this is V1 and V2 is not working properly and the possible reasons and 

There could be several reasons why the code is running slowly or becoming unresponsive. Here are a few possible explanations:

1. Processing Power: Depending on your system's processing power, running a computer vision and machine learning-based code may require significant computational resources. If your system is not powerful enough, the code may run slowly or even crash.
2. Video Frame Size: The code processes each frame of the video feed from the camera, and the size of the frames can also impact performance. If the frames are too large, it may cause the code to run slowly.
3. Mediapipe: The `mediapipe` library used in the code is an open-source library developed by Google that provides a lot of functionality for machine learning-based computer vision tasks. However, it may require significant computational resources to run.
4. Webcam Driver Issue: The camera driver could be malfunctioning and causing delays.

To improve the performance of the code, you could try the following:

1. Upgrade your hardware: If possible, upgrade the system's hardware to a more powerful CPU or GPU.
2. Reduce the size of the frames: Resizing the frames to a smaller size could help to reduce the processing time.
3. Reduce the complexity of the code: Simplifying the code, such as reducing the number of face landmarks detected or reducing the frequency of mouse clicks, could help improve performance.
4. Check the camera driver and settings: Check if the webcam is functioning correctly and its driver is up-to-date.
5. Check if the mediapipe version is the latest one.

By implementing these steps, you may be able to improve the performance of the code and reduce the occurrence of unresponsiveness.
